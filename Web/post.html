                    <p>Leaders in north-west Queensland say the success of small rural communities must be a priority if the upcoming white paper on developing northern Australia is to achieve its goals.
                    </p>

                    <p>The Federal Government is due to release the white paper at the end of June.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Queensland Country Hour has spent this week travelling along the Flinders Highway in the state's north and has heard from communities that claim their townships must remain vibrant and liveable is the north is to fulfil its potential.</p>
                    
                    <p>Paul Woodhouse, a grazier near Julia Creek and chair of Regional Development Australia Townsville and North West Queensland, said any future development in northern Australia hinged on its existing communities.</p>

                    <blockquote>"We have to understand that while we are going through a very difficult patch, that difficult patch is the result of around about eight years of floods, droughts, cancellation of live export orders and a number of unfortunate decisions by government," he said.
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>In essence, we are hopefully at the end of a perfect storm. But at the end of the day, the biggest strength that northern Australia has is its existing communities. They are the nexus of growth for the next century.</p>

                    <p>"All we have to do is support the communities that are in place and build their capacity, [including] water, energy, communications and transport to make sure they not only survive, but work well."
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Impact on the Community</h2>
                    
                    <p>Mr Woodhouse, who is also chair of the North West Hospital and Health Board, said he had a "slight degree of scepticism" about the rhetoric of developing northern Australia, but the white paper process was "the strongest measure the Commonwealth Government has put in place for a long time".</p>

                    <p>Further west along the Flinders Highway, Cloncurry Shire chief executive officer David Neeves said liveability of small rural communities needed to be a major focus if governments wanted to develop the north.

                    <p>The Cloncurry Shire is the source of more mining royalties than any other local government area in Queensland, although it has a far more diverse range of mining activity than other areas that are entirely focused on coal.</p>

                    <blockquote>"We probably see [the current mining downturn] more as a softening of the market, but it is certainly impacting our communities," he said.

"Local mines around here are probably consolidating a little bit, rather than closing their doors like in other areas."
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>Nonetheless, Mr Neeves said the shire was very much an agricultural centre, rather than a mining centre.</p>
